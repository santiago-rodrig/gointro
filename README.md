# Introducing Go - Answers to the Exercises

> By Caleb Doxsey, ISBN 978-1-491-94195-9

This is a repository that holds the answers I came up with for
the exercises given in every chapter of the book. Most of the
files are markdown files with the textual answer, while some
answers are just Go source code.
